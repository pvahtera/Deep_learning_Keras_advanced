# Deep_learning_Keras_advanced


Solving a variety of problems using the versatile Keras functional API. 

Starting with simple, multi-layer dense networks and continue on to more complicated architectures. 

Includes how to build models with multiple inputs and a single output, as well as how to share weights between layers in a model. 

Also includes advanced topics such as category embeddings and multiple-output networks.
